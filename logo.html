        information about the logo 
    </h1>

    <p> 
        According to Steve Jobs, the name of the company was inspired by his visit to an apple farm and he thought the name "Apple" was fun. The first Apple logo was designed by Ron
       Wayne and depicts Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. But it was immediately replaced by Rob Janoff's "Rainbow Apple", the now-famous one-bite apple. Later, Apple has officially abandoned the colorful design and started using monochrome logos.
