        Jobs went to Reed College for a semester and then dropped out. He spent 18 more months dropping in on more creative classes. Steve was a businessman most famous for his work with the company Apple Computer Inc, starting with the release of the Apple I in 1976.Together with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Jobs helped make the idea of the personal computer popular in the late 1970s. In the early 1980s, still at Apple, Jobs was one of the first to see the potential of using a mouse to control things on a computer screen. In August 2011, Jobs resigned, and was appointed Chairman of Apple. He served in that position until he died, at the age of 56, on October 5, 2011 from complications of pancreatic cancer.
